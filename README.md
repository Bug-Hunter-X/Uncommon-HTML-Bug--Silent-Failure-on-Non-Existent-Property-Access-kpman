# Uncommon HTML Bug: Silent Failure on Non-Existent Property Access

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML/JavaScript interaction that can be tricky to debug.  The core issue is attempting to access a non-existent property of an HTML element, which doesn't throw an explicit error but leads to unexpected behavior.

The `bug.html` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.html` file provides a corrected version.

This type of error is uncommon because it doesn't generate a typical JavaScript error, making it harder to detect.  Always validate your DOM object's properties before access. Consider using optional chaining or nullish coalescing operators for more robust code.
